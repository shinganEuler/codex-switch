## [1.3.2][] - 2026-04-14

### Added

* `customRemoteFiles` storage mode with a machine-scoped
  `codexSwitch.remoteFilesRoot` setting for synced directories such as Dropbox.
* Token freshness checks before switching profiles, using `last_refresh`
  to write back newer runtime auth data to stored profiles.

### Changed

* Rebranded the project as Codex Profile Switcher for the
  `shinganEuler/codex-switch` fork.
* Switched packaging and publishing scripts from the deprecated `vsce`
  package to `@vscode/vsce`.
* Removed `.vscodeignore` so packaging relies only on `package.json.files`,
  which matches current `vsce` requirements.

## [1.3.1][] - 2026-04-05

### Added

* Automatic publishing to <https://open-vsx.org/> in the release workflow.

* Duplicate detection now uses identity-first matching.
  (PR #10 by @panella87)
* Duplicate detection is workspace-aware while preserving identity-first logic.
  (follow-up changes on `master`; aligns with PR #5 by @iqdoctor)
* Status-bar click behavior is explicitly configurable via
  `codexSwitch.statusBarClickBehavior`:
  `cycle` (cycle all profiles) or `toggleLast` (switch current/previous).

  (PR #4 by @iqdoctor)
